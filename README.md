## About Minesweeper
Minesweeper is a single-player game where one must clear the rectangular board without clicking on any of the bombs. You
receive clues about the mine placement based on the numbers, where the number determines the amount of mines in the 3x3 area surrounding it.

## Game Description
The game has a beginner difficulty, intermediate difficulty, and an advanced difficulty. These expand the board based on the difficulty. To place a flag, right click, and to open a space up, left click. You will lose if you click a mine and you will win if you clear the board.
